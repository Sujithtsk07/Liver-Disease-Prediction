Introduction
      Liver diseases are a significant public health concern worldwide, and early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and management. This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based predictive 
model to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing liver diseases. By leveraging a dataset of patient records and implementing various classifiers, the model aims to accurately predict the presence or absence 
of liver diseases based on patient characteristics and clinical parameters.


- Data Preprocessing: Perform data cleaning, missing value imputation, and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for modeling.
- Classifier Implementation: Implement different machine learning classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), etc., to build predictive models.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of each classifier using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the classifiers using techniques such as grid search cross-validation to optimize model performance.
- Model Comparison: Compare the performance of different classifiers and identify the best-performing model for liver disease prediction.
